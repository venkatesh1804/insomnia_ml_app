# Insomnia Severity Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting insomnia severity levels using
machine learning techniques applied to sleep-related features.

A Streamlit-based web application is developed to provide an
interactive and user-friendly interface where users can view
prediction results easily.

The trained machine learning model classifies insomnia severity
into categories such as Mild, Moderate, and Severe.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
- Streamlit
- Pandas, NumPy

## Project Features
- Insomnia severity classification
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- Pre-trained machine learning model
- Modular and clean project structure

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is not included in this
repository due to size and licensing constraints.


## Note
This project is developed for academic and learning purposes.
